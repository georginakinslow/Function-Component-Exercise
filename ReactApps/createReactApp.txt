CREATE REACT APP

Create React App is a simple Command Line (AKA Terminal) command to run which sets up everything we need to start creating a React Web App

The command to run is...

npx create-react-app app-name

NOTE: The command will create a folder with all the React features inside of it. This folder will be created inside of the folder the command is run inside of. Also, what is put after "create-react-app" (In this case it is "app-name") will be the name of the created folder. Finally, it is common practice to use all lowercase letters separated by hyphens (Example: my-app)

Commands to start the React app after it has been created...

cd app-name
npm start

To stop the React App that is running in terminal, press the following keys...

Control + C
